(1) React Testing Library and Jest both have different responsibilities "react testing library" is not a test runner meaning when u enter 
command npm test or npm run test it is jest responsibility that collect all the files ending with .test.js and runs each test case and show 
pass and fail results in your console.

(2) react testing library provides you function to catch dom element and perform some action below are some of its function

render, fireEvent, waitFor, screen

you can also use Enzyme(another popular testing library) for such function to access dom element

(3) EXTRA: developer often confuse among

jest
react-testing-library
Enzyme

Here Enzyme and react-testing-library are two similar things and alternatives to each other means you can use

- enzyme with jest or
- react-testing-library with jest
- you can also use all three i.e react-testing-library+Enzyme with jest
- but you can not use Enzyme and react-testing-library without jest or any other test runner eg: Mocha

(4) where jest(testing-framework) will collect all .test.js files execute all the test cases and put the output in console with detail like how many 
pass and fail and react-testing-library or enzyme(both are testing library) will help you to perform event and accessing dom element.
